OpenStreetMap Tile Attribution Issue Tracker
======================================

This repository is used for reporting and tracking sites which are using tile.openstreetmap.org tiles but without attributing OpenStreetMap. The sites are tracked in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/openstreetmap/tile-attribution/issues).

Please [create a new issue](https://github.com/openstreetmap/tile-attribution/issues/new/choose) to report problematic case. Note that some steps needs to be first taken first. This steps are listed at the new issue template.

Help with educating people about attribution requirements is welcome and helpful, reporting cases where it has not resulted in improvements is also encouraged.

[Lacking proper attribution](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Lacking_proper_attribution) OSM Wiki page is closely related listing, covering all kind of cases of attribution issues. While this repository covers only cases where entities are using OMSF servers, where OSM community already attempted contact and was ignored.
